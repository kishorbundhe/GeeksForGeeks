/*Given N points on the cartesian plane.  We need to find the minimum number of steps required to traverse all points (from start to end) in the same order as given.  From a point, movement in all 8 directions are possible and every movement is counted as a step.

Input :
The first line of input contains number of test cases T. For every test case, the first line contains the number of points N and the second line contains the sequence of points represented by 2*N numbers.

Note : Points are given in the following order : x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 â€¦.. and so on)

Output :
For each test case, Print the minimum number of steps required to reach end point from starting point by traversing the sequence in order.

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 10^6
0 <= Value of coordinates (x,y) <= 1018

Example :
Input :
2
3
0 0 1 1 1 2
4
1 0 1 2 6 3 6 4
Output :
2
8

Explanation :
For test case 1 :
The starting point is (0,0) and the ending point is (1,2). Now, (1,1) can be reached from (0,0) in 1 step and (1,2) can be reached from (1,1) in 1 step, therefore the answer becomes 2.

For test case 2 :
The starting point is (1,0) and the ending point is (6,4). Now, (1,2) can be reached from (1,0) in 2 steps, (6,3) can be reached from (1,2) in 5 steps and (6,4) can be reached from (6,3) in 1 step, therefore the answer becomes 8.
